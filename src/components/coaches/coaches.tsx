            description="Katherine is a professional integral coach, with a passion for collaborating with people who have the courage and compassion to take responsibility for building the life they choose, and a willingness to consider various possibilities to find balance and meaning. She believes that self-knowledge is a foundational life skill.  Self-knowledge is developed through exploring current habits and behavioural patterns, and noticing emotional responses and triggers to everyday life events and relationships. This process of building the muscle of self-correction develops resilience and strengthens mental health, while working towards personal coaching goals and outcomes. Coaching is therefore a powerful way to foster self awareness and enhance oneâ€™s capacity to face obstacles with strength and confidence. It is both about prioritising the self, as well as taking responsibility for who we are in the world."
